<br>Hello, my name is Marcylle. I'm interested in Cybersecurity, Computer Network and Network Security at the moment.
<br>I'm currently studying about Computer Network, VLAN (how to set up VLANs using Packet Tracer is what I'm enjoying the most), Router, Switch, NAT, Link Aggregation, etc. As I mentioned, I'm using Packet Tracer for my labs.
<br>I've also studied Windows and Linux Servers (Installation, Configuration and Hardening), AD domain controller, Samba, etc. Recently concluded a Database SQL (Microsoft SQL Server, OracleDB, MySQL and MongoDB) module. 
<br>Hope to use this to document everything I'm learning, projects I am working on, some tutorial like posts maybe, we'll see.
